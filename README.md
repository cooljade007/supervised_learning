# OVERVIEW

This project focuses on practicing the variety of methods used during supervised learning.

We worked with a fictitious charity organization called CharityML whose goal is to provide financial support for individuals that are interested in learning machine learning. CharityML sends letters to people in the community in hopes that they will donate to their cause. Through this process, they learned that those individuals who have a $50,000 annual salary, are more likely to donate. As part of this project, we are to help CharityML in building an algorith that would best identify potential donors in order to reduce the overhead cost of sending mail. I experimented with three types of supervised learning: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Adaboost.
